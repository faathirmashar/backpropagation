<P>
This program supports export of the network (including current weights) to a xml file. You can load it back later from the New task screen. You can save the file to the SD card (and later copy to your computer) or anywhere else on the local filesystem where this program has access rights. You can also send by an e-mail by some application configured in you Android OS.
