<P>
All the network with all neurons (black circles) and connections (lines between two circles) and biases (short horizontal lines) is shown here. Numbers are connection weights and bias values. Input is on the top and output at the bottom. This screen may be useful for small networks but there is not enough space to show all about large networks.
