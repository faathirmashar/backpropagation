<P>
Training set is simply a set of pairs (input x, expected output for input x). Feel free to type any real numbers but input will be scaled to <I>&lt;-1, 1&gt;<SUP>m</SUP></I> (it is better for the algorithm) and output to <I>&lt;0, 1&gt;<SUP>m</SUP></I> (neuron output is always between 0 and 1). It will be rescaled during the computing back so you will always work with your original numbers.
