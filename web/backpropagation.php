<H2>Backpropagation algorithm</H2>
<P>
This is just a basic introduction to artifitial neural networks and backpropagation algorithm. Large networks trained by this algorithm (with many improvements) can do lot of very interesting stuff. They can detect some object in a picture, make a weather forecast, predict the next word in a text etc.
