<H2>Import from CSV</H2>
<P>
This program supports import of the network anatomy and training set from a CSV file. You can load the file from the SD card or from anywhere else on the local filesystem where this program has access rights. You can also download it from the www by a button press here or <A HREF="examples/">from the native android browser</A> by the special backpropagation:// URL scheme handling.
</P>
<P>
The CSV format is pretty well human readable and also supported by the most spreadsheet programs so it is the right format for import your own tasks.

<P>
See <A HREF="exportcsv.php">the export screen help</A> for the exact format explanation.
